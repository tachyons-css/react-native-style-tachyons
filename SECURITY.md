# Reporting Security Issues

The maintainers take security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/tachyons-css/react-native-style-tachyons/security/advisories/new) tab.

The maintainers will try to send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report within 60 days. After the initial reply to your report, the maintainers will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module. You can also report a vulnerability through the [npm contact form](https://www.npmjs.com/support) by selecting "I'm reporting a security vulnerability".
